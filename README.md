# Rock Paper Scissors – JavaScript Console Game

## 📋 Project Overview

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Rock Paper Scissors game using **vanilla JavaScript**. The game is played entirely through the **browser’s console**, with no UI elements required. It serves as an excellent introduction to JavaScript fundamentals such as functions, variables, conditionals, loops, and user input.

## 🎯 Assignment Goals

The main goal of this assignment is to build a functioning Rock Paper Scissors game that plays five rounds between a human and the computer. You’ll practice:

- Setting up a basic HTML/JavaScript project
- Writing functions in JavaScript
- Generating random choices for the computer
- Capturing user input using `prompt()`
- Implementing game logic using conditional statements
- Keeping score over multiple rounds
- Outputting results using `console.log()`

## 🧩 Features

- Human vs. Computer gameplay
- 5 rounds per game
- Randomized computer moves
- Input via browser `prompt()`
- Score tracking and final result announcement in the console
- Entirely console-based interface — no HTML buttons or forms required

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- HTML (minimal, just for script loading)
- JavaScript (core logic)
- Browser Developer Console (for interaction)

## ✅ What You Will Learn

- How to structure a small JavaScript project
- How to use JavaScript functions and control flow
- How to take user input with `prompt()`
- How to use `Math.random()` for randomness
- Basic use of `for` loops and global variables
- Console debugging and logging with `console.log()`

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Create `index.html` and `script.js` files
2. Link the JavaScript file in the HTML
3. Write the game logic inside `script.js`
4. Open the HTML file in your browser and use the console to play

## 📦 Project Status

This project is meant as a learning exercise and does not include UI features. In later lessons, you’ll learn how to refactor the game with buttons, event listeners, and responsive design.

## 📚 Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of HTML and JavaScript
- Understanding of variables, functions, and conditionals
- Familiarity with the browser console and developer tools

## 📝 Instructions Summary

- Set up a basic project with HTML and JavaScript files
- Create a function for computer choice (`getComputerChoice()`)
- Create a function to take human input (`getHumanChoice()`)
- Track scores using variables
- Write a function to play a single round
- Use a loop to play 5 rounds and display the final winner

## 📌 Note

All interactions take place in the **console**. There is no need to build a visual interface for this version. Mobile compatibility and UI design will be introduced in future projects.
